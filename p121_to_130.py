# Q.121
# print( 2 ** 3)  # Output is 8

# Q.122
# The main difference between lists and tuples is lists are mutable but tuples are immutable.

# Q.123
# l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# start = 0
# end = len(l)-1

# while start <= end:        # This is how we can reverse a list.
#     temp = l[start]
#     l[start] = l[end]
#     l[end] = temp
#     start+=1
#     end-=1
# print(l)

# Q.124
# l_none = [None for _ in range(4)]     # This is how we can create a list with 4 none values
# print(l_none)

# Q.125
# in keyword can be used to start a loop over a list.
# Example:
# l = [1,2,3,4]

# Q.126
# The append() method accepts an argument and add it in the end of the list.

# Q.127
# l = [1,2,5,7]
# l.remove(2)     # We can use remove() method of lists to delete a value in the list. 
# print(l)

# Q.128
# s = "string"
# sliced = s[1:4]
# print(sliced)     # Returns the letters at index 1 to 3.

# Q.129
# lst = [2,4,6,8]
# print(lst[:len(lst)-1])   # This is how we can get all the elements except the last element in the list.

# Q.130
# The pop() method of a list removes and returns the last element of a list.
