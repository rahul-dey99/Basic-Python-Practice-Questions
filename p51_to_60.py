# Q.51
# lst = []    # This is how we can create an empty list.
# print(lst)

# Q.52
# l = len([1,2,3])
# print(l)      # Output: 3

# Q.53
# l = [1,2,3]
# l.append(4)     # By using append() function we can add element to the list.
# print(l)

# Q.54
# l = [1,2,3]
# l.pop()       # By using pop() function we can remove last element from a list.
# print(l)

# Q.55
# a = [1,2]
# b = [3,4]
# c = a + b     # or we can use the extend() function.
# print(c)

# Q.56
# my_list = [1,2,3]
# my_list.insert(1, 'a')     # The insert() function inserts a at 1st index.
# print(my_list)      

# Q.57
# lst = [_ for _ in range(6)]      # This is how we can create a list from 0-5
# print(lst)  

# Q.58
# Append Method: The append() method adds any element at the end of the list.         used for a single element.
# Extend Method: The extend() method can be used to extend a list with another list.  used to add 2 lists.

# Q.59
# l = [1,2,3,4]
# idx = l.index(3)      # We can use index() method to find index of a given element.
# print(idx)

# Q.60
# l = [1,2,3]
# mult = l*2          # It re-adds all the elements in the list and doubles the size of the list.
# print(mult)
